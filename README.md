# LMF_Revised_TvT
## Description
This version of the revise of the LMF is specifically ment for TvT like scenarios.

## Requirements:
In order to use this Framework, you need to run these mods alongside it:
* CBA_A3
* ACE3
* ACEX
* ACRE2 or TFAR

## Installation:
Copy over the contents of the "LMF_R_TvT.VR" folder into your mpmission folder.\
Installation is done.

### For mission makers:
Here a small rundown on how create a mission using the Framework.

__VR Mission:__\
The Framework comes with a form of template mission. In this template you will find examples on how to configure your mission
to properly use most of the Frameworks' various components. There are many different ways to get the components from this VR
mission into yours, but as an example let's just say you changed the .VR ending of the template mission folder to fit the map
you want your mission to be on and then dragged all components to where you want them to be.

__Settings Folder:__\
After you have properly placed all Framework relevant things in your mission and removed the ones you don't need,
head over to the settings folder and configure all the setting files according to your preference.

__Gear:__\
How much items Player units, vehicles and supplies get is already pre-configured by default. If you want to change anything
about that you can do so in the files found in `framework\player`.

__Testing:__\
It is highly recommended to test your mission extensively while having "show script errors" enabled.\
That way it is more likely you will spot any form of mistake you have made while setting up your mission
and scripts.

### Variables
This Framework uses global variables starting with prefix var_ and prefix lmf_.

## Additional
If you are unsure of what you are doing and this is your first time using this Framework to make a mission, it is recommended to get help from
someone that is more experienced with it.
